    Code to flatten a highly nested JSON is shamelessly stolen from Alina Zhang,
    https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-flatten-deeply-nested-json-objects-in-non-recursive-elegant-python-55f96533103d
    This code is quite cool as it appends the key names to keep track of nest level
    so if the first key was 'tiger' and its value was a nested object in which a key was 'orange'
    and its value was another nested object which had a  key 'fast' that just went to a normal value 4
    it would say 'tiger_organe_fast' : 4, so you know how to find this value

        Flatten json object with nested keys into a single level.
        Args:
            nested_json: A nested json object.
        Returns:
            The flattened json object if successful, None otherwise.
