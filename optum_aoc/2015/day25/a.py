"""
An overkill solution.
The overall strategy comes from observing that we need to calculate
INITIAL * (SCALER ^ power) (mod QUOTIENT)
so we can do some nice maths to simplify some things.
1) Since the quotient is prime, we can use Fermat's little theorem to simplify
the expression.
2) Observe that if p = 2^n, then x^p = x^(2^n), which is the same as squaring
x repeatedly n times. This is exponentially faster than multiplying x by
itself 2^n times! Then if we write power as a binary number, this is a sum of
powers of 2, and so we can calculate (SCALER ^ power) exponentially fast using
this trick.
NOTE: We use the concept of 'modular arithmetic' frequently. This just means
finding the remainder of all results upon division by QUOTIENT.
