"""
Maths time!

So rather than checking through all 176,851 combinations of weights,
we can instead recognise that this problem is a convex optimisation problem.
This guarantees that gradient ascent will find the optimal solution.

To see that the problem is convex:
1. The set of all ingredient weights resulting in a positive score is a
convex set, as it set of solutions to all of a collection of linear
inequalities. (Draw a bunch of straight lines, and staying inside of all
of them gives a convex set).
2. For the non-zero values, the score is a product of positive linear
functions, and hence is convex.

To find the solution via gradient ascent, we start with a random guess, and
then pick the nearest neighbour solution with the highest score, and repeat
until we cannot improve on the solution anymore.

We repeat this strategy for part 2:
1. Find the optimal solution regardless of calories
2. Optimise the first solution with respect to how far from the calories
target the recipe is. So the new solution will have the target calories.
3. Optimise the second solution with respect to the score again, but this time
only allowing changes in solution which keep the total teaspoons and calories
fixed.

This ended up being a long and complicated solution, so I can't recommend it.
But hey, it's fast!
